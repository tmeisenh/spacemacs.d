My spacemacs configuration
==========================

A mostly barebones configuration for spacemacs.

## Layers ##
  * config: various configurations that don't make sense for a layer (org-mode)
  * display: stuff to make emacs look pretty
  * langs: coding stuff, mostly javascript
  * macros: empty
  * personal: a few enhancements like bitcoin ticker in mode bar
